1.  Describe Middleware, Sessions (as we know them in express), bcrypt and JWT.

    - middleware is software that executes between something. In our situation, it executes between the request and resolve.
    - sessions is library that we can use to add functionality. It allows us to store small amounts of data including whether someone is logged in.
    - brypt library that we can use to hash and compare hashed passwords
    - JWT - JSON Web Tokens are encrypted data. We store it in local storage. It's a string that is generated by the jsonwebtoken library and then later stored by the client. It is used for client authentication. The client then has to produce that token whenever they want to interact with the server so that the server can confirm that the client has access.

1.  What does bcrypt do in order to prevent attacks?

    - it gives it salts before hashing and also limits the speed at which passwords can be hashed

1.  What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?
    - JWT are made from a combination of header, payload, and signature. The signature is a combination of the header (the type of token and hashing method used), the encoded payload that you can put key value pairs/claims into, and lastly a signature which is the above two combined with a secret and generated with the above method stated in the header.
